Exercises for Computational Physics 2 simulations

In this repository exercises for Computational Physics 2 are saved. 
New simulations will be added during the semester, till all exercises are online.
The code will be written either in python or c. 

Course Overview:
    Monte Carlo Simulations
    Moleculardynamics
    Longrange Interactions
    Entropy und free Energy
    Rare events
